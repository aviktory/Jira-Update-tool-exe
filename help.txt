Quicky/version 1.2

1. Clone 
Program looks for all Test executions within a specified Test plan(ex. HRENABLING-71666) which have summary(name) field ending on the specified suffix. 
When such Test execution is found, new Test execution with the new summary suffix(replacement of original suffix) is created and all test cases 
assigned to the original Test execution will be assigned to the new one. 

2. Update test status  
Program  looks for results in a specified Worksoft result folder(ex. DEUTSCHE TELEKOM/Sandbox/aviktory) within a Worksoft project, 
which were executed on a given date. Program takes the most recent result(StartTime) from the given date if more results of a Worksoft process exist. 
Then program looks for a test case with the same name(summary) in the specified Test execution in Jira(ex. HRENABLING-71667). 
In case of a match, the Worksoft test results(passed, failed, aborted) are set for the test cases in Jira. 
You can insert multiple Test execution keys, they must be each in a separate row. 

3. Settings 
Set up login data(token) for Worksoft and JIRA API access. 

4. Config
Update config.ini files if URL to JIRA API or Worksoft API have to be changed(change only base of URL, ex: "https://customer.jira.telekom.de") 
MAXIMUM_JQL_SEARCH_TEST_CASES in config.ini determines maximum test runs returned from a test execution in JIRA. In case a test execution in JIRA includes more than 300 tests(default value), update the value in config.ini.
